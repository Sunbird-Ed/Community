### [Observation](https://sunbird-ed.github.io/docs/mobile/modules/ObservationModule.html)

&#x20;Observations are a set of questionnaires that are specific to a particular entity (such as a school block or cluster). Observations can be recorded at multiple instances, whenever necessary.



### [Survey](https://sunbird-ed.github.io/docs/mobile/modules/SurveyModule.html)

Surveys provide data as opinions/feedback of one who is filling out the survey. These are not taken up or recorded against any specific entity. Surveys can only be taken up once as the surveys are filled as feedback or information or ideas for an event/activity/process. Surveys can also be time bound and the creator can define the time period. After the defined time period, the survey expires and users will not be able to access the form. Though, data submitted by any user before expiring is always available.

### &#x20;[Questionnaire](https://sunbird-ed.github.io/docs/mobile/modules/QuestionnairePageModule.html)

The questionnaire is used for rendering different types of questions. Seven different types of questions are supported by the questionnaire. Once the observation or survey is started, all the questions are saved locally, and only upon submission, the data will be submitted to the backend.
