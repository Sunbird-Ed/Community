# Verifiable Credentials



SunbirdED enables the user to earn digitally verifiable credentials in the form of Certificates. These certificates have QR codes that can be used to further verify user information. Sunbird ED allows the user to maintain their own digital passbook with all the credentials. Users can continue to hold these credentials against their profiles and also download them for offline usage as well.&#x20;
