# What is a Program?

A Program enables organizations to define, run and track a set of related activities to achieve a specific set of goals, with precise tracking of progress and completion. A Program is time-bound with a defined start and end for completion. A Program can be targeted to multiple sets of target users. A Program consists of different activities such as - taking a set of surveys, doing a set of improvement projects, taking a set of observations, etc. Each activity within a Program can have its own set of target users and a defined schedule.
