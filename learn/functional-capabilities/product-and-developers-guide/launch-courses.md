# Launch Courses

Launch Courses cover major aspects of the following functional needs:

**Batch Management**: Create Batches with specified start/end dates to create a virtual cohort of users to consume the content. Batch enables the creator/mentor of the course to access the reports in a similar manner.

**Content State/Course Progress**: Every content consumption of the user is used to calculate the progress of the course. This is facilitated by Content State Read/Update API. The same information is carried into course reports, exhausts, etc.

**Digital Learning Passbook**: Once the user has completed the course, all the history of user's performance on the course, certificate received are persisted as part of "Digital LEARNING passbook". This Information will exist with the user along with his profile information.
