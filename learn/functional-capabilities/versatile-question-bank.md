Question set player emits **telemetry data** (i.e. signals) for each action performed by the user. This makes a rich data pool available, which can be aggregated to get all types of insights. It is through these insights that various actors can make informed decisions. Data Dashboards are available on the consumption interfaces to show progress at the individual or institutional level. For example, imagine a set of tests held at engineering colleges helps identify the concepts where most students are weak. The aggregated data across geography made available to the right stakeholders at the right time, helps arrive at timely interventions and long-term plans (like maybe the base of this concept isnâ€™t understood well during high school, and the intervention is to be done then).
