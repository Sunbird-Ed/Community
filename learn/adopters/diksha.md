# DIKSHA

Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing (DIKSHA) is a national platform for school education, an initiative of National Council for Education Research and Training (NCERT), Ministry of Education. It was launched in 2017, and has been adopted by all 36 states and UTs of India.&#x20;

Each state/UT leverages the DIKSHA platform in its own way, as it has the freedom and choice to use the varied capabilities and solutions of the platform to design and run programs for their teachers and learners. DIKSHA policies and tools make it possible for the education ecosystem (educationist, experts, organisations, institutions - government, autonomous institutions, non-govt and private organisations) to participate, contribute and leverage a common platform to achieve learning goals at scale for the country.
