# Asset Sourcing

The **Asset Sourcing** capability is enabled by the following components of _**Sunbird CoKreat**_

**Sourcing Web App**

Sourcing Web App is an application that allows creators to source assets from in-house or through contributions from outside. A few key features of Sourcing Web App are:

1. Allows contribution and curation at scale with a large set of contributors
2. Provide recognition and data about contribution to contributors

**Contribution Service**

The Contribution Service is a microservice that provides API to enable organizations to digitally plan, coordinate, and manage crowdsourcing of assets for defined projects. These services are leveraged by the Sourcing Web App to:

1. Create and manage projects to get the crowdsourcing of assets
2. Provide the ability to nominate and manage nominations made to the project
3. Provide the ability to add, update, read user and project preferences
