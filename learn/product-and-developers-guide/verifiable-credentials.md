_a)_ **Completion Certificate**: This Certificate is provided to the user upon the completion of the course. The only Criteria for issuance of this certificate is to complete the course consumption.

\
_b)_ **Merit Certificate**: A Merit Certificates can be configured by the creator for issuance when the user meets certain scoring criteria. It is possible that both types of certificates can be configured on a course. For e.g. Creator can set  70% & above score as merit certificate criteria. \
