# What is a Survey?

Surveys on the Managed Learn are designed to gather valuable opinions and feedback from users without being associated with any specific entity. Participants can only take the survey once, using it as a platform to provide feedback, share information, or contribute ideas related to events, activities, or processes. Creators have the flexibility to define a time limit for the surveys, after which access to the form is restricted. However, data submitted by users before the expiration remains accessible for review and analysis, ensuring valuable insights are retained for decision-making and improvement purposes.
