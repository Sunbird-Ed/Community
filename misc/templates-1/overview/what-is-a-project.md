# What is a Project?

The improvement project empowers leaders to outline and monitor a series of tasks, guiding users toward achieving specific improvement objectives. These projects are accessible to users with roles such as Teachers, HT (Head Teacher), and Officials in their profiles. The project is broken down into actionable micro-tasks, and relevant learning resources are incorporated into these tasks. Content creators on the platform have the authority to create and manage such improvement projects.
