# Build, Provision and Deploy

To install SunbirdED `release-6.0.0`, we will need to run many Jenkins jobs and a couple of manual steps. Some of the jobs need to be run in a specific order. This page details out the list of jobs, their order and the github release tags to be used for each job.

**Create Plugin Containers / Folder Structure**

* We will create few folders in object storage for storing sunbird plugins
* Our deployment job always tries to delete the folder first before uploading, so we need to have the placeholders before running the jobs
* Create a public object storage with the name you have set for the variable `cloud_storage_content_bucketname`
* Under `cloud_storage_content_bucketname` create folders with below names.
  * collection-editor
  * generic-editor
  * content-editor
  * v3/preview (under v3 folder create preview folder)
* Upload the default T\&C file to `cloud_storage_content_bucketname` in a folder named **terms-and-conditions**. You can get a copy of the sample T\&C file from [here](https://sunbirdpublic.blob.core.windows.net/installation/terms-and-conditions/terms-and-conditions-v9.html). You are free to edit the HTML as per your requirements
* Create another object store with the name you have set for the variable `cloud_storage_label_bucketname`
* Go to cloned sunbird-devops repo and navigate to `cd sunbird-devops/utils/portal` and upload all files to `cloud_storage_label_bucketname`

**Upload Initial Plugins**

* Upload the initial set of plugins to `cloud_storage_content_bucketname` container
* Download the initial Plugins from [here](https://sunbirdpublic.blob.core.windows.net/installation/content-plugins.zip)
* Unzip **content-plugins.zip** and upload all the files and folders to `cloud_storage_content_bucketname/content-plugins` object storage
* Create a object storage with name you have set for the variable `cloud_storage_public_bucketname` with public access level
* Create a object storage with name you have set for the variable `cloud_storage_artifacts_bucketname` with private access level

**Upload Maxmind Database to Object storage**

* Download the Maxmind city database in zip format from Maxmind website
* Upload the zip file to the `cloud_storage_artifacts_bucketname` object storage

**Build source code**

> **Note**:
>
> * Jenkins will have many jobs which may not be documented or is not suitable for adoption yet
> * Jobs listed on this page is sufficient to setup Sunbird and not every job present in Jenkins is required to be run
> * Jobs can be run in parallel to speed up execution. The only exception is you should **NOT** run multiple jobs which clone the code from same repo in parallel
> * If you get errors in some of the build jobs, rerun the job again
> * The errors are usually due to missing maven jars or maven repo timeouts
> * If you get errors even after re-running the job, come back to it later, there are other jobs which would generate dependent jars

**Artifact Upload**

* Every job in the **Build** directory has a corresponding job in **ArtifactUpload** directory with the same name
* These jobs are auto triggered and usually run without issues after the corresponding job in the build directory succeeds
* The job will fail if your ansible inventory setup is incorrect or incomplete
* If the job has failed, fix the ansible variables issue and rerun the job to upload the artifact / docker image
* Ensure the artifact upload jobs are successful before proceeding

**Service Deploy**

> **Note**:
>
> * We will run the jobs which are a pre-requisite for other jobs first
> * The pre-requisite jobs reside in different folders so we will be jumping across folders
> * Jobs in the **Deploy** directory can be run in parallel and don’t have any restrictions if the code is from same repo unlike the **Build** directory
> * Ensure you don’t run those jobs in parallel which modify the databases (such as cassandra, neo4j etc)
