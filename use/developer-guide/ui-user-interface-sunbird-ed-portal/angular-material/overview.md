# Overview

## **What is Angular Material and what does it solve for?**

Angular Material is a UI component library for Angular applications. It provides a set of pre-designed and pre-built user interface components and styles that developers can use to create modern, responsive, and visually appealing web applications with Angular. Angular Material is built following the principles of Google's Material Design guidelines, which aim to provide a consistent and intuitive design language for web and mobile applications.

Here's what Angular Material solves for:

1. **Consistency**: Angular Material enforces a consistent and well-defined design language based on Material Design principles. This consistency helps developers create applications that feel familiar and are easy to navigate for users.
2. **Design Efficiency**: It saves developers time and effort by offering a ready-made set of UI components with a cohesive design. Developers don't need to spend as much time designing and styling components from scratch.
3. **Accessibility**: Angular Material components are designed with accessibility in mind. They include keyboard navigation and are compatible with screen readers, ensuring that applications built with Angular Material are accessible to a wide range of users, including those with disabilities.
4. **Responsive Design**: Angular Material components are responsive by default, adapting to different screen sizes and orientations. This helps developers create applications that work seamlessly on various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
5. **Modularity**: Angular Material is modular, allowing developers to import and use only the components they need. This helps keep the application's bundle size small and improves performance.
6. **Integration with Angular**: Angular Material is designed specifically for Angular, making it a natural choice for Angular developers. It integrates seamlessly with Angular's ecosystem and leverages Angular's features and capabilities.
7. **Community Support**: Angular Material has a large and active community of developers, which means there are plenty of resources, tutorials, and third-party extensions available to enhance applications built with Angular Material. Community support can be invaluable for troubleshooting and learning.
