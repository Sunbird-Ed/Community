# SB-Themes Repository: Unifying Design Across Platforms

The SB-Themes repository serves as a standalone repository that plays a pivotal role in both the Sunbird-Ed portal and the Sunbird-Ed mobile application. It embodies a unified design philosophy that ensures a consistent visual identity across these platforms.

**Themes for Sunbird-Ed Portal:**

Within the portal, SB-Themes introduces two distinct themes, each with its corresponding dark mode version:

1. **Classical Theme:** This theme offers a timeless and conventional visual style, catering to users who prefer a classic aesthetic.
2. **Joyful Theme:** In contrast, the Joyful theme brings vibrancy and energy to the portal's design, creating a visually engaging and joyful user experience.

**Dynamic Theme Switching:**

The magic lies in the use of CSS3 variables, which enable dynamic theme switching. When transitioning from one theme to another, structural changes occur throughout the portal.&#x20;

This includes adjustments to the layout, button styles, card designs, modals, select boxes, and more. These changes align seamlessly with the chosen theme, ensuring a cohesive and visually pleasing user interface.

**Consistency Across Platforms:**

The same design philosophy extends to the Sunbird-Ed mobile application, ensuring that users experience a harmonious and familiar visual environment regardless of the device they use.

In summary, SB-Themes offers a versatile and efficient approach to theming, enhancing the user experience by providing choices and maintaining design consistency across both the Sunbird-Ed portal and mobile application.
