# Material Icons

Angular Material Icons are a set of icons designed to work seamlessly with Angular Material and can be easily integrated into your Angular applications. These icons are based on Google's Material Design Icons and provide a consistent and visually appealing set of symbols for your user interface.

To use Angular Material Icons in your Angular application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Angular Material Icons**: To confirm that Angular Material Icons are installed in our project, we can achieve this by adding the following line in **`style.scss`** file.

@import url( 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Material+Icons');
```

This link imports the Material Icons font, making it available for use in our application.

2. **Use Material Icons in HTML**: We can include Material Icons directly in our HTML templates using the **`<mat-icon>`** element. For example:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<mat-icon>home</mat-icon>
<mat-icon>favorite</mat-icon>
<mat-icon>menu</mat-icon>
