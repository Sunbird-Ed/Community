# Buttons

Our button component in the Sunbird-Ed portal utilizes the `sb-btn` class as the default style. It's versatile, with variations available in primary, secondary, warning, error, and gray colors, each represented by specific classes like `sb-btn-primary`, `sb-btn-secondary`, and others.

We offer an outline button variation to provide a different visual style. These are denoted by classes like `sb-btn-outline-primary, sb-btn-outline-secondary` and others.
