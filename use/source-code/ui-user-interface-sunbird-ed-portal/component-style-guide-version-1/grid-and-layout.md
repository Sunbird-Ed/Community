**8 Point Grid System:**

Our portal employs an efficient 8-point grid system for layout and spacing. This systematic approach ensures consistent and harmonious content placement, contributing to a polished and user-friendly design.

**Reasons for the 8-Point Grid System:**

The variety of screen sizes and pixel densities has continued to increase making the work of asset generation more complicated for designers. Utilizing an even number like 8 to size and space elements makes scaling for a wide variety of devices easy and consistent. Smaller components, such as iconography and typography, can align to a 4dp grid.

1. **Consistency:** The 8-point grid system provides a standardized and consistent framework for layout and spacing, ensuring a uniform visual identity across the portal.
2. **Efficiency:** It simplifies the design and development process by offering predefined increments, making it easier to align elements and create balanced compositions.
3. **Responsive Design:** The 8-point grid system is well-suited for responsive design, allowing content to adapt gracefully to various screen sizes and resolutions.
4. **Accessibility:** By adhering to consistent spacing, the portal enhances accessibility and readability, improving the overall user experience.
5. **Maintenance:** The system simplifies design maintenance and updates, as adjustments can be made systematically, minimizing the risk of design inconsistencies.

In summary, the 8-point grid system is chosen for its ability to maintain design consistency, streamline development, support responsiveness, and enhance user accessibility within the Sunbird-Ed portal.
